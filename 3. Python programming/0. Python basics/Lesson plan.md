- [WATCH] [functions]()
    - [DEMO] variables
        - variable assignment
            - `age = 23`
            - we can overwrite any variable at any time
            - we dont have to specify the type of any variable in advance (although this can be done in python)
        - comments
            - comment the line
            - comments are anything that follows a hash symbol on any line
            - python doesnt treat comments as code, so they dont get run
            - use comments to explain what your code does
            - [DEMO] you can also make a multiline comment with triple quotes
        - data types
            - every variable has a type 
            - our age is an int(eger)
            - we can also have decimal numbers, which we call floats
                - `height = 1.8`
            - strings are characters in quote marks
                - `name = 'Harry'`
            - boolean variables have one of two values: true or false
                - `staff = True`
                - `lame = False`
                - in python they must start with a capital
            - lists
                - `possessions = ['laptop', 'bike']`
                - can contain any types of data (create list of string and int)
                - a list is an example of something called an interable
                    - that means that we can go through it's items one by one
                - indexing list items with []
                    - python is zero-indexed
            - tuples are like lists, 
                - we write them with parentheses rather than square brackets
                - but they are immutable, that means they cannot change
                - they are also iterable
                - `parents = ('mum', 'dad')`
            - dictionaries map keys to values
                - keys can be strings or ints but the values can be any type
                - make the person dictionary: `{'name': 'Harry'...}` (use both newly created variables and existing variables as values)
                - indexing a dictionary with []

    - basic operators
        - +, -, *, /
        - %
        - **
        - %
        - some operators make sense on non-numeric data
            - add strings together
            - multiply strings
- [CHALLENGE] 
    - create one variable for every of the following type
        - string for your name
        - boolean for female or not
        - integer for your age
        - float for your height
        - list of strings for the names of the people in your group
        - list of integers for the ages of the people in your group
        - list of mixed types representing your name, age and height
        - dictionary containing keys for your name, age and height
    - one by one share your screen to share your work with your group
- [DEMO] slicing
    - as well as just selecting elements, we can select a portion of the string containing multiple elements. We call this slicing
    - slice from 1:2
    - if we leave out the first index, it assumes from the beginning by default
    - if we leave out the last index, it assumes to the end by default
- [WATCH]
    - [DEMO] flow control
        - `if staff:`
        - conditional operators
            - and
                - if 
            - not
            - or
            - `>`/`>=`
            - in 
    - loops
        - for loop
            - iterate through any iterable, like a list
            - `for possession in possessions:` print possession
        - while loop
            - age += 1; print age
        - break
            - break out of loop if age > 18
        - continue stops this 
            - if age == 10: continue
- [ASK] why is a float called a float?
- [CHALLENGE] is a string iterable?
- [CHALLENGE] write a for loop that adds every number in a list to a running total
- [WATCH] functions
    - functions
        - [EXPLAIN] a function call
            - show the `print` function
            - when you put parentheses (round brackets) on the end of it, you're calling the function. That's a function call
        - [EXPLAIN] builtin functions
            - [SHOW] other examples
                - type
                - len
                - round
        - [DEMO] making your own function
            - `def info(age, name):`
                - `print(f'{name} is {age} years old')`
            - anatomy
                - name of function
                - arguments separated by commas
                - parentheses
                - colon to indicate indented block to follow
                - indented block after
                - default arguments
                - docstring
        - [DEMO] unpacking arguments into functions
            - `*` pass a list of age, name, height into a function
                - `details_list = ['Harry', 23]`
                - `info(*details_list)`
            - `**` pass a dict of the same params to the function
                - `details_dict = {'name': 'Harry', 'age': 23}`
                - `info(**details_dict)`
        - [DEMO] unpacking into a list or dictionary
            - unpacking can also be useful outside of passing arguments to functions
            - `name, age = details_list`
            - note that this only works for lists
- [EXPLAIN] pair programming
    - pair programming is where one person shares their screen and codes, whilst talking through what code should be written with the rest of the group
- [CHALLENGE] (15 mins)
    - write a list for everyones name in your group
    - write a for loop that prints each of the names 
    - write a function which takes in a name, then if the name is more than 6 letters long returns true and prints "long name!"
    - add a docstring to your function
    - add another argument to your function which is their favorite color
    - give a default value of `None` to the color
    - now change the list of names to a list of dictionaries with 2 keys: name and fav color
    - call the new function in the loop, and unpack the arguments into it
